## Choosing colors variations for your next web app

### How the color choosing works?

The project ideia is to generate variations for the colors on your color pallete. The new color tones would be brighter alongside with being darker or lighter.

Take the color `#3C21AC` <ColorPreview colorHex="#3C21AC" className="insideText" /> as an example below:

<ColorPicker colorHex="#3C21AC" />

One of the possibilities for a darker tone, would be the color `#160c3f` <ColorPreview colorHex="#160c3f" className="insideText" />.

In this case we indeed get a darker tone, but it is also grayer than the original color (as the saturation was decreased too).

<ColorPicker colorHex="#160c3f" />

The new color have a low luminosity, as expected. But also lost a bit of their saturation.

With this project method, we would be able to define the new color while manteining the saturation values a bit better (It still needs to be decreased a bit for a more natural look)

This way we get the color `#0f053b` <ColorPreview colorHex="#0f053b" className="insideText" />

<ColorPicker colorHex="#0f053b" />

The method consists in choosing the new colors by making an arc on the color selection box.

In this way, darker tone would move to the right a bit and lighter tones would move to the left a bit (how much it moves depends on the variation you need).

In the real world, the colors on the lights and shadows are influenced by the enviroment around. So shadows are not gray or black, but could have tints of blue, for instance. 

If we would creating a digital painting, the enviroment created would dictate how this influence would happen. In a UI Design, it has no real enviroment.

In this case, i have assumed some of this variations based on common things. Like the Blue above.

In our example, the new color with hue variation would be `#13042e` <ColorPreview colorHex="#13042e" className="insideText" />

<ColorPicker colorHex="#13042e" />

A lighter color using this method could be: `#5055e3` <ColorPreview colorHex="#5055e3" className="insideText" />

<ColorPicker colorHex="#5055e3" />

<ColorList title="Colors without the Method" colorList={[{ hue: 252, saturation: 96, lightness: 59 }, { hue: 252, saturation: 68, lightness: 40 }, { hue: 252, saturation: 68, lightness: 15 }]} />
<ColorList title="Colors with the Method" colorList={[{ hue: 248, saturation: 64, lightness: 60 }, { hue: 252, saturation: 68, lightness: 40 }, { hue: 266, saturation: 86, lightness: 16 }]} />

### When should I use this method?

It is one more method you could use and may or may not be needed. Could fit in one project or not. And I recomend you to make little adjustments on the colors you get to refine with your projects needs in mind.
You could not need all the variations given and choose only some of them, it is your choise.
